Building a CRM website in django

This website is based on a tutorial series by Dennis Ivy, I found on YouTube 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv_bwpA_aEA&list=PL-51WBLyFTg2vW-_6XBoUpE7vpmoR3ztO).

This tutorial gives a deep insight into web development with Django. I have learned a lot during this series and I was even able to 
complete the Django LinkedIn Skill Assessment with ease after finishing it.

The series covers many core functionalities of modern MVC web applications, such as
* Models and Databases
* Views
* Templates
* URL Routing and Requests
* Authentication
... and much more.

With the knowledge that I have gained, I will be able to develop and deploy my own applications.
